# Campster

Campster is a bootcamp project based on a 50-hour Udemy course titled "The Web Developer Bootcamp" taught by Colt Steele for developing websites.

The website allows any user to create an account, add a campground, and review the campground by leaving comments. Authentication and authorization/permissions are essential considerations; only the user who created the comment/campground may modify it. 

The MongoDB database is hosted by [mLab](https://mlab.com) and the website is hosted by [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com).
